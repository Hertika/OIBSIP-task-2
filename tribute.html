       <h1>Introduction</h1>
       <br>
       <p>Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.</p>
       <br>
       <p>In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.</p>

       <h1>Philosophy Of Satyagraha</h1>
       <br>
       <p>Today, we know Satyagraha as the Gandhi’s favorite and also an efficient method of peaceful protest. But, what does Satyagraha means? It is derived from two Sanskrit words “Satya” and “Agraha”. Former refers to the “truth” while latter means “holding firmly to it”. Thus, Satyagraha, means “holding on firmly to the truth”.</p>
       <br>
       <p>
        The Gandhian philosophy of Satyagraha has been derived from truth itself. Truth that is eternal, inevitable and can’t be defeated could be used as a weapon of peaceful protest to fight against any kind of oppression or injustice
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>For Gandhi Satyagraha was a fight between a pure, noble and true soul and an oppressive enemy. Satyagraha is a method of peaceful protest, something which would ultimately overwhelm the enemy with love and innocence, however powerful he may be, and force him to pay heed.</p>
       <br>
       <p>
        Gandhi opined that Satyagraha could successfully be applied against governments to consider the demands or to stop the injustice. His firm belief in Satyagraha was an outcome of its success during his stay in South Africa
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        He saw Satyagraha as the fundamental birth right of every individual. Though, the path of Satyagraha is arduous and one following it must be ready to face every eventuality and suffering, nevertheless, the oppressors will bend and the Truth will always emerge victorious.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        According to Gandhi, the method Satyagraha is widely applicable to personal, professional as well as social life. Anyone can successfully use Satyagraha to fight against injustice in a family or on a national level.
